## Description

ILCS App is a digital time tracking application that has an online dashboard for employees and for management. The app allows employees to submit or edit their work time sheets. It also includes organization tools for management to use to view, edit and filter employees time sheets. This was developed to be used internally by Independent Living Care Services (ILCS), which is a small company that provides in-home personal care at multiple locations across the Twin Cities.

## Getting Started

This project should be able to run in your favorite IDE. I used VS code while building it.

### Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Copy the SSH key in your new repository
3. In your terminal type...  `git clone {paste SSH link}`
4. Navigate into the repository's folder in your terminal
5. Open VS Code (or editor of your choice) and open the folder
6. In the terminal of VS Code run `npm install` to install all dependencies
    (this is important to the name npm packages that are required to run this app.)
8. If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `SAMAN` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js` file
9. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you need to test the app. Copy and paste those queries in the SQL query of the database.
10. Run `npm run server` in your VS Code terminal
11. Open a second terminal by clicking the + button and run `npm run client`

## Usage

Once everything is installed and running it should open in your default browser - if not, navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/.

## Deployment
All registered users are admins of their own assets, locations, and containers. Users cannot manage other users but could be part of future updates.

# Simple Asset Management
Simple Asset Management (SAMAN) is exactly what the name suggests, easy organizing of your belongings. SAMAN makes it easy for any organization or individual to get organized and help reduce unnecessary losses. Unlike other asset management software, SAMAN does NOT cost an arm and a leg, in fact, it's free!

## Versioning
I used Git and GitHub for version control.
